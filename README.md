## Features:
- Color your pixels by pressing them (duh!)
- Create, save, open and export your art (options available in the upper action bar)
- Zoom in, zoom out, create new paper with your size
- Add new color

## Hidden tips:
- Long pressing one of the pixels will let you "pick" that color as the current one
